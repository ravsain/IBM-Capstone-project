# IBM-Capstone-project
## Welcome to my data analytics capstone project on IBM! 
I
For this Project i had been working as a Data Analyst for a large international IT and business consulting organization that is renowned for its knowledge of IT solutions. The company frequently analyzes data to help determine future skill requirements in order to be competitive and keep up with rapidly evolving technologies. I will be supporting this program as a data analyst, and I have been given the responsibility of gathering information from various sources and spotting trends for this year's report on developing skills.
### So each process in analysing the data is stored in the Jupyter notebooks that are uploaded. 

#### Week 1 data collection 
My first task is to gather a list of the most in-demand programming skills from job advertising, training websites, and polls, among other sources. In order to gather data in many formats like.csv files, excel sheets, and databases, I will start by scraping internet websites and using APIs.
#### Week 2 data wrangling 
Data wrangling techniques will be used to prepare the acquired data for analysis.
#### Week 3 exploratory data analysis 
Once I've retrieved and cleaned enough data, I will use statistical methods to analyze the data. 
#### Week 4 data visualisation 
Involves creating charts and graphs to visualize the data 
#### Week 5 building a dashboard 
I'll use IBM Cognos Analytics to build a dashboard that will compile all of the data and nd spot trends and insights that might include the following:
Which programming languages are most in demand today?
What are the most in-demand database skills?
Which IDEs are the most popular?
#### Week 6 presentation of findings.
I will use storytelling to share my findings in a presentation.
